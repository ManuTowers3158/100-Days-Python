# Initialize a counter variable with the value 0
counter = 0

# Start a while loop that continues as long as the counter is less than 10
while counter < 10:
    # Print the word "Hola" followed by the current value of the counter
    print("Hola", counter)

    # Increment the counter by 1 (equivalent to counter = counter + 1)
    counter += 1
